My Placce
(£. Rozmuszyñski)
 
 Where sight of no one reachs
 I keep on staying and creating
 Where in dreams I always land
 I live on dreams all the time
 Where the air is light
 There's no chance to loose breath
 Where human didn't exist
 Nature is not polluted

  Where all my friends go 
  Where all my thoughts go
  Where all my time is spent 
  Where all my love went
  Is my place, there's my place
  Is my life, there's my life

 Where life don't have an end
 I make-believe there's no disease
 Where the weather is still
 Misfortune and death doesn't work
 Always rational thoughts disappear
 To let dreams have freehand
 Simple life like living in utopia
 If you only want it

  Where all my friends go
  Where all my thoughts go
  Where all my time is spent 
  Where all my love went
  Is my place, there's my place
  Is my life, there's my life

 First true love first happiness
 Which you'll experience only there
 If you only desire anything
 You will have in a trice
 Why only you have to decide
 With who you will share this
 True friendship will be on
 To the time you want its end

  Where all my friends go
  Where all my thoughts go
  Where all my time is spent 
  Where all my love went
  Is my place, there's my place
  Is my life, there's my life

 There I want to live
 There I want to be on
 There I want not to count time
 There I want not to hurry anymore
  I'll return everything to get there
 And to be forever immortal
 It'll only be another dream
 Not satisfied hope in my life
 
  Where all my friends go
  Where all my thoughts go
  Where all my time is spent 
  Where all my love went
  Is my place, there's my place
  Is my life, there's my life
