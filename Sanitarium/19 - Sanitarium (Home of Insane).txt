Sanitarium (Home of Insane)
(£. Rozmuszyñski)

 I'm the only one who's livin' here
 Hiding all fears inside my head
 Making mad all the time of my life
 Finding truth outside my mind
 Keeping losing own courage
 Coma became last thing to rescue
 I'm making myself a lethal weapon
 Cause I'm livin' alone in Sanitarium

  They can't release me from this horror
  They can't realize how much pain I deal
  Just find me a password letting me free

 I'm the last one dying here
 With no prospects of livin' further
 No plans about escape from this hell
 Made by myself in my own head
 New world which wants me forever
 Giving me hope of better life
 Aftter death, occure sooner than I think
 Cause I'm dying alone in Sanitarium
 

  They can't release me from this horror
  	They've made me
  They can't realize how much pain I deal
  	They're livin' blindly
  Just find me a password letting me free 
  	You're my last hope
 
 I'm the man without all hopes here
 No one could help me now
 No one wanted to do anything for me
 You al livin' save inside your homes
 Don't realize danger of me living here
 But I'm going to be free now or later
 Then I'll thank you all for keeping me locked
 Cause I'm the last man in Sanitarium
  			Keeping alive
 
  They didn't want to release me from this horror
  	They will pay for this
  They couldn't realize how much pain I dealt
  	They were livin' blindly
  The password has let me free
  	The lethal weapon is hunting for them

 They were keeping me locked inside Sanitarium
 But I ran away and became a lethal weapon
 Now they can't stop me from killing them
 Cause they have to pay for doing me such pain

 I'm the lethal weapon
 I have nothing to loose
 I can't hear	their voices
 I can't see	their faces
 I can't feel	anything
 I'll kill'em all
 I ran away	from Sanitarium
