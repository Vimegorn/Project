Manifest Destiny
(£. Rozmuszyñski)

 When I look out thru window
 Paralysing fear embrace me
 Eyes certained vision of true
 End which will approach
 All of this takes any hope
 Not only me but you too
 It will soon happen
 What I have seen already

   My destiny is presented me
   Not seems to leave me free
   Nothing is all I know  
   So that I have to go

 I look at people everywhere
 Without idea what waits for them
 They are still hurrying up
 Go where they have already been
 But I don't want this
 Terrified of tomorrow day
 Want to experience something new
 Run away from our reality

   My destiny is presented me
   Not seems to leave me free
   Now nothing is all I know  
   So that I have to go

 I still think about the same
 Only not to have this deja vu
 Why I have to feel it
 But you will mature to this
 Too late to try to survive
 All of you without hope
 I've seen what's for me
 And it's not a pleasure

   My destiny is presented me
   Not seems to leave me free
   Now nothing is all I know  
   So that I have to go

 It waits not only for me
 But for everyone here
 For believers and not believing
 They'll have what they deserve
 Blood, death and conflagration
 Crop of your vanity in life
 Harvest earlier than you want
 I have seen destiny

   My destiny is presented me
   Not seems to leave me free
   Now nothing is all I know  
   So that I have to go

 Its awful
 Its real
 Its terrible
 It will happen
 Revalated pain
 Revalated fear
 Revalated death
 Its doomed for us

   My destiny is presented me
   Not seems to leave me free
   Now nothing is all I know  
   So that I have to go
