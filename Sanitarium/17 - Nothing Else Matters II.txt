Nothing Else Matters II
(£. Rozmuszyñski)

 All my life I didn't realise
 What we choose is what we get
 Now its too late for me
 And nothing else matters

 Never found pleasure in doing harm
 We hurt others on different ways
 All this words are true
 And nothing else matters

 Look into a heart of your friend
 Don't judge him for his view
 Cause we are beatiful inside
 And nothing else matters

  Never cared for what they do
  Never cared for what they know
  But I know

 I believed in lies which they said
 Always done what they said
 Should have stopped it 
 And nothing else matters

 Truth lay always between
 Life seems to be a risk
 We should trust each other
 And nothing else matters

 Wanted to help everytime I could
 But no one agreed my offers
 We must face all our problems
 And nothing else matters

  Never cared for what they do
  Never cared for what they know
  But I know

 Even though we need a hand
 Sometimes we ought to let a friend
 Not lock ourselves in our own heads
 And nothing else matters
 
 I owe all people I met
 That I know somethings about life
 We have to experience all
 And nothing else matters
 
 We need to renounce all bad things
 That seems to be the hardest way
 But I believe we could do it
 And nothing else matters
