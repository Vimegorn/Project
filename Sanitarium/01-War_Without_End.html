WAR WITHOUT END
(L. Rozmuszynski)

WAR WITHOUT END
STARTED FAR TIME AGO
AND WE'RE VICTIMS
OF THIS CIRCULARITY

OUR ANCESTORS HAD GREAT IDEAS
BUT SOME OF THEM WAS A MISTAKES
AND WE'RE VICTIMS 
OF THEM

  ENDLESS WAR
  YOU MUST FIGHT FOR YOUR FREEDOM
  HUMAN'S ENVY PREVENT US TO STOP
  ENDLESS WAR

THEY ALLOWED FOR THIS 
SO THEY MUST FIRST DIE
NO RESPECT FOR LIFE
THEY DID IT TO US

EUTHANASIA, INVENTION OF LEGAL KILLING 
EVERYONE SCORN OTHER LIFES
IT MUST BE CHANGED
FROM THIS DAY

  ENDLESS WAR 
  YOU MUST FIGHT FOR YOUR FREEDOM
  BEFORE YOU'D BE DEAD
  ENDLESS WAR

INNOCENT PEOPLE DIE
BECAUSE THEY'RE BLIND
WE MUST TELL THE TRUTH
EVERYTHING WILL BE LOST

WHAT WE CAN DO TO STOP THIS?
I SAY NOTHING WE CAN DO 
AGAINST TANKS AND FIGHTERS
WE'RE TO WEAK TO DEFY THEM

FEAR OF LIVING IS BIGGER THAN YOU THINK
YOUR LIFE MIGHT END ON NEXT CROSS

APOCALYPSE WILL FOLLOW THIRD WORLD WAR
AND IT WILL BE OUR FAULT AMONG OTHERS
WE'VE STARTED THIS WAR
AND WE CAN'T STOP IT

WAR WITHOUT END
