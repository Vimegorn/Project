Dark Way
(£. Rozmuszyñski)

 Why I feel this pain
 		I cannot see anything
 Darkness overpower me
	 	I cannot see anything
 Smell of death in the air
		I cannot see anything
 Light glares my eyes
	 	I can see the light
 Blood is running like stream
		I can see a face
 Draught of cold tickle my cheek
 		I can see a corridor
 At the end is a way out
 		I can see a face
 Face from my nightmares
	 	I'm running
 Too slow I can't make it
 		I'm still running
 I feel breath on my neck
 		I turn back
 I fall into a blood pool
 		I can see a face
 I can see a blow to me
 		I can see the light
 The end is near
 		I hit
 He fell on his knees
 		I see fear in his eyes
 He prays for mercy
 		I blow
 Inert body fall in front of me
 		I turn back
 Pain takes over me
 		I can see the light
 Now or never is my way
		I'm running
 I am almost there 
 		End of my way
 I fall in the dark Here's no way out
		Here's no way out
