Theory
(£. Rozmuszyñski)

 Till this day my life was as others
 But when I've met my best friend
 I started to think about all things
 Soon I've knew true which you don't believe

  So open your mind
  For this new theory
  Start to think about
  Tomorrows day
  Theory will find a way
  To kick your ass and stay
  Better start to pray

 Everyday I see through closed eyes 
 Can't help people cause I don't see
 Never thought about other blind men
 I know there're more them like me

  So open your mind
  For this new theory
  Start to think about
  Tomorrows day
  Theory will find a way
  To kick your ass and stay
  Better start to pray
