What She Said?
(£. Rozmuszyñski)

  I can't forget what she said
  Why she looked if I'm dead
  I don't feel l'm doing wrong
  And I'm not going to be fond
  I won't change in the beast
  I'm no that kind at least

  What she said was what she thought
  What she did was what she wanted
  What she showed was what she felt
  What she hid was what she was ashamed
  What she saw was what I showed
