A Poem of Young Age
(£. Rozmuszyñski)

Words are pronouncing not singing, It's reciting like a poem.
It was originaly wrote for language lesson when I was 15 years old. 


 Only a fool writes about his virtues,
    and not mention about his vices,
 Only a fool always do what I say to him,
    and not listen what he wants within,
 Only a fool is viewing in himself,
    and not learn humility through life.

[BRIDGE SOLO]

 I don't want to be a fool,
  but I'm not a sage,
 Don't want to be a sinner,
  but I'm not saint,
 Don't want to be mischievous,
  but I'm not kind-hearted,
 Don't want to be condemnation,
  but I'm not salvation,
 Don't want to be alone,
  but I'm not popular,
 Don't want to live depend to others,
  but I'm not independent.

[ACCOUSTIC SOLO]

 No one from us is perfect,
 No one from us is glorious,
 No one from us is ideal,
 No one from us is repetitive.

 Day in day we live,
 Day in day we meet each other,
 Day in day we get to know each other,
 Day in day we talk.

 Joyful and opened we must be
 Block and close us not let them 
 In peace and harmony we must live
 For us and for others we must be kind.

 So in live we must be ourselves,
 So they won't say that we have past.
 
[SOLO]

 Take my best wishes and start a new life,
 Do what you want to do,
 Be who you wanna be,
 Say what you want to say,
 See what you want to see,
 Think what you want to think,
 And remember that you're inimitable, 
 And you're who you're and anyone can't change it,
 Because you're perfect and ideal on your own way!!!

[Ending Bass Solo]
[When notes are more silent and more silent] 

 In the end everything will matter when all of us will stayin front of Final Court, and our Lord.
