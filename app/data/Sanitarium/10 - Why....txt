Why...
(£. Rozmuszyñski)

  You've never known
  What you want from life
  You've never drown
  When you couldn't dive
  You've never cried
  Even if you lied

   All I wanted from you
   Was a little bit of true
   All I received
   Was that you leaved
   Without saying goodbye
 
 For the first time I met you
 I've known we will get thru
 I did not want it enough
 Time with you wasn't rough
 But you didn't want to go further
 You didn't want to get together
 You was my first passion
 You've taken my session
 Nights with you weren't scary
 Nightmares became rarely
 It was when I didn't know
 How you was running low

  You've never known
  What you want from life
  You've never drown
  When you couldn't dive
  You've never cried
  Even if you lied

   All I wanted from you
   Was a little bit of true
   All I received
   Was that you leaved
   Without saying goodbye

 Why you was always lying me
 If you had been honest you could be free
 But you want to live without compassion
 All your friends where to shy
 Your life could have end to early
 If I hadn't seen it clearly
 Why I was pushing you too much
 I want you to start from scratch
 And try to help forget
 But it proved that its bad target
 It was that true reason
 That you get away before end of season

  You've never known
  What you want from life
  You've never drown
  When you couldn't dive
  You've never cried
  Even if you lied

   All I wanted from you
   Was a little bit of true
   All I received
   Was that you leaved
   Without saying goodbye

 Why you lied me
 Why you run from me
 Why you didn't want my help 
 Why it was your choice

 Tell me why you've done all this things

 Why you lied me
 Why you run from me
 Why you didn't want my help 
 Why it was your choice
