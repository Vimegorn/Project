METALIZATION
(£. Rozmuszyñski)

Your life is a pile of lies 
And we're here
To show you the truth

You was blind
You didn't see
That everyone was fleecing you

But now you can be one of us
Join our culture
And you will see in what you was wrong

 Metalization of your inner soul
 Start from now
 You can't stop it
 You can't restrain it
 So you must retire (give in)

Your life will be better
You must trust us
You won't lose much more than you lost

When you'll look back
You would see
How have you been stupid

Nevermind that
You'd be wiser now
You'd be just like we are

 Metalization of your inner soul
 Start from now
 You can't stop it
 You can't restrain it
 So you must retire (give in)

You know now
What they wanted from you
Now you can fuck'em all

You're now just like we are
You're from metal kind
Your life is in leather and metal

You have lost your mind
You've heard our metal
So you'd be forever with us

 Metalization of your inner soul
 Finished now
 You couldn't stop it
 You couldn't restrain it
 So you have retired (gave in)

Salvation of your life
Is in progress
And it will be done
Like the metalization

Metalization Metalization

Metalization is done
