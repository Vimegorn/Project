THE LORD OF LIFE
(£.Rozmuszyñski)

I devour souls
I deprive of life
You won't escape me
You won't deceive me
I was, I am and I'll be
I won't disappear
I'll wait for you
I'll lurk I'll hide in shadow
You won't escape, you won't disappear
Cause I'll find you

 I am death
 The beginning and the end
 The first and the last
 Cause I'm death
 I'm your fate, your destiny

I cause much pain
It's an ecstasy for me
You don't see me but you feel me
You're a part of my plan
Which you call destiny
There's no creature whose I miss
Everyone has the same calculation
You won't escape, you won't disappear
Cause I'll find you

 I am death
 Everything touched by me turns into misfortune
 Everything dies when I want
 Cause I'm death
 I am your fate, your destiny

I'm waiting for you
You are doomed me
You'll die, this is my plan
You haven't got a way out
You won't escape, you won't disappear
Cause I'll find you
My name is known you
Cause I am death
I am fate and destiny

[Solo]
 
 I am death
 I devour souls
 I deprive of life
 Cause I'm death
 Master of fate
 Master of destiny

 Bow to me!
