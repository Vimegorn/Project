Withering Hammer
(£. Rozmuszyñski)

 Hey where am I
 Is it hell or worse
 Hey you're here too
 What do you think about this
 Will you help safe our lives
 And leave it all with it self

  Withering hammer
  Is coming for us
  We can't escape
  It'll take our souls
  To eternal world

 Hey where you go
 Its not our way to go out
 Hey stop going there
 Are you deaf I said something
 Oh no he's not from our kind
 He's a servant of our enemy

  Withering hammer
  Is coming for us
  We can't escape
  It'll take our souls
  To eternal world

 Hey now I know
 It has found us
 Hey we must hide
 No we can't it'll find us
 We're now a history
 Because it kill all of us

  Withering hammer
  Is coming for us
  We can't escape
  It'll take our souls
  To eternal world

 It'll do inconceivable pain
 It'll hit extremly fast
 It'll kill everyone here
 Then go back to its home
 And hide in the shadow of darkness
 Because its worse than all hell

  Withering hammer
  Is coming for us
  We can't escape
  It'll take our souls
  To eternal world

[SOLO]

  Withering hammer
  Came for us
  We couldn't escape
  It has taken our souls
  To eternal world
  And damned us forever

Withering hammer!
