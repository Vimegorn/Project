A Man Who Sold The World
(£. Rozmuszyñski)

 I don't want to feel like this
 Rain clatter in my window
 I can't pick my thoughts
 And do something important

 All my life is being sold
 I can't stop this enterprise
 Why it happened to my
 I'm making myself insane

  I don't want to be
  A man who lied the world
  I don't want to be
  A man who sold the world
  Don't let me be   Insane

 Take this sorrow from me
 I can't handle it's to big
 Pain is withering my soul
 I won't hoist this fraught

 Rain still clatter in my window
 All my senses are going bad
 And I'll be sensless soon
 Oh pray for better prize 
 
  
  I don't want to be
  A man who lied the world
  I don't want to be
  A man who sold the world
  Don't let me be   Insane, INSANE!

[SOLO 1]

  I don't want to be
  Another insane man
  I don't want to live
  With a sorrow on my face
  I don't want to have
  Signs after this pain
  And I don't want to be
  A man who sold the world

[SOLO 2]

 All the things are sold
 All the feelings lost
 All the human race is dead
 All my live has end

 I didn't want this enterprise
 I can't turn the time back
 All the sorrow I've made 
 Will reflect on me till the end

  I didn't want to be
  A man who lied the world
  I didn't want to be
  A man who sold the world
  You had let me be   Insane
  And You had lost yourself!

  I didn't want to be
  A man who lied the world
  You had let me be   Insane

 And I'm now
 A man who sold the world!
