The Middland
(£. Rozmuszyñski)

 Somewhere in the world
 Is a land
 Where people 
 Live in peace
 With elves, dwarves and other creatures

 I lived there for many years
 But when the ring was destroyed
 I had to leave
 But now i know
 There's my place

  Middland, place where I left my soul
  Middland, place where I left my heart
  Middland, place where I left my friends
  Middland, place where I want to spent my life

  Immortality of me,
  I don't need it,
  If i could, I would return it
  To back to the Middland!

 I've met many creatures
 I've learned many spells
 I've had many experiences
 I've had many wounds

 I've seen many places
 But nowhere was
 As beatiful as it was
 In the Middland

  Middland, place where I left my soul
  Middland, place where I left my heart
  Middland, place where I left my friends
  Middland, place where I want to spent my life

  Immortality of me,
  I don't need it,
  If i could, I would return it
  To back to the Middland!

 I want get back in the time,
 And stay in the Middland
 That is my last wish
 When I'm on common sense
 
 Middland, Middland, Middland

 Oh, Middland   Where are You!!!
