LIGHT IN THE MORIA
(D. W³odarski, £. Rozmuszyñski)

NINE WANDERERS
CAME INTO MINE
IT WAS A MORIA
A BASE OF DWARVES 

IT WON'T BE FUNNY
WHEN THEY FIND THEM
THEY'LL HAVE TO FIGHT 
WITH EVIL SERVANTS

 LIGHT, LIGHT
 LIGHT IN THE MORIA
 LIGHT, LIGHT 
 LIGHT IN THE MORIA

THEY WAS THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING
THEY'VE SET OUT FROM RIVENDELL
THEY WANDER THROUGH THE MOUNTAINS
THEY FOUGHT WITH WOLVES

THEY CAME INTO A PIT
CALLED KHAZAD-DUM
THEY FOUND THERE
BALINS GRAVE AND BOOK

 LIGHT, LIGHT
 LIGHT IN THE MORIA
 LIGHT, LIGHT
 LIGHT IN THE MORIA

THEY WENT THROUGH THAT BOOK
AND SUDDENLY TREMBLED
BECAUSE THEY HEARD 
DRUMS FROM UNDERGROUND

THEY STOOD UP TO ONE'S FEET
THEY WERE CUT FROM ONE SIDE
THEY WERE ATTACKED
THEN FLASHED A WHITE LIGHT

 LIGHT, LIGHT 
 LIGHT IN THE MORIA
 LIGHT, LIGHT
 LIGHT IN THE MORIA

LIGHT CAME
FROM GANDALFS WAND
IT GLARED EVILS EYES
TEAM STARTED TO ESCAPE

THEY RUN DOWN THE STAIRS
SUDDENLY THEY SAW A BRIDGE
THE BRIDGE OVER ABYSS
THEY'VE RUN THROUGH THE BRIDGE

SUDDENLY FROM THE DARKNESS
LEANED A HORRIBLE MONSTER-BALROG
IT FOUGHT WITH WIZARD(GANDALF)
AND FELT WITH HIM INTO THE ABYSS

 LIGHT, LIGHT
 LIGHT IN THE MORIA
 LIGHT, LIGHT
 LIGHT IN THE MORIA

DESPAIRED TEAM
RAN TO EXIT FROM MINE
THEY HEARD DRUMS AGAIN
BUT THEY RAN AWAY ON TIME

THEY SAW A DAYLIGHT
AND DEVIATE FROM GATE
EVILS FEEL LOATHING TO DAYLIGHT
SO THEY WON'T CATCH THEM

 LIGHT, LIGHT
 LIGHT IN THE MORIA
 LIGHT, LIGHT, LIGHT
 LIGHT IN THE MORIA
