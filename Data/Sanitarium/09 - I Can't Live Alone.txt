I Can't Live Alone
(£. Rozmuszyñski)

 When I meet you
 I feel like now you
 When I talk with you
 Feel like talk with angel
 When I walk with you
 Feel like walk to heaven
 
 So why you disdain me
 Why you reject my love
 Am I not good for you
 Am I so disgusting
 And you feel nothing
 Tell me, is it true 

  But I can't live alone
	     without you
  I can't live alone
	     without love

 Do you know what I feel
 When I meet you everyday
 Do you imagine yourself
 What harm you do to me
 When you don't look at me
 Say, do you understand this

 If you hear out me once
 If you try let me say once
 If you let me close once
 Maybe I could choke it out
 What really matter in my life
 Tell me, do you know what it is

  But I can't live alone
	     without you
  I can't live alone
	     without love

 When I see your face
 My heart starts palpitate
 When I hear your voice
 Like angels aria of love
 When I meet with your sight
 Deep like the oceans depth

 Why you are so inaccessible
 Why I'm coward in front of you
 Why I can't share this feeling 
 Which I want to give you
 You play major roles in my dreams
 Tell me, would you answer me

  But I can't live alone
	     without you
  I can't live alone
	     without love

 I could return everything for you
 Fame, money, soul or whole world
 Only to spare a moment with you
 Only to hear that you feel same
 Tell me, is it possible
 I can't longer run from your way

 I can't further hide in shadow
 I'll go out from dark of a night
 And show myself in full daylight
 In the light which came from heaven
 And I will be with you side by side
 Till the end, till end of our days

	[Solo]

  I couldn't live alone
	     without you
  I couldn't live alone
	     without love
  I couldn't forgive
 	     from myself
  I couldn't escape 
	     from my life
  And you know why its true

 Because...
 I couldn't...
 Live alone...
 No No No I couldn't
 Live alone
