Meaning Of Life
(£. Rozmuszyñski)

 I'm staying on the station
 There's no one else
 I take the gun in my head
 And ask myself this question
 Why I want to do that?
 I've got a girl, I've got money
 I've got fame, I've got power
 I've got almost everything
 Except only the faith
 I've lack of hope also love
 It's enough to shoot
 Unless I get those three things
 
  Life is not to take
  More often you need to give yourself
  We must believe in where we're going
  We must have hope to continue our purpose
  We must find love to support us in bad times
  Believe, cherish hope and love will come
  Change your life, calculate it
  Go back on your way to fulfilment

 He's staying on the bridge
 There's no one else
 Ties a rock to his leg
 And ask himself this question
 What the hell i'm doing here?
 He has got great job
 He has got money, three properties
 Two cars, shares on the exchange
 Got almost everything
 Except only the faith
 He has lack of hope and love
 Its enough for him to jump
 Unless he will give up material goods 

  Life is not to take
  More often you need to give yourself
  We must believe in where we're going
  We must have hope to continue our purpose
  We must find love to support us in bad times
  Believe, cherish hope and love will come
  Change your life, calculate it
  Go back on your way to fulfil dreams

 She's sitting in her room
 There's no one else
 She twist off the gas
 And asks this question
 Do I really have to do that?
 She's got family and education
 She's got all life before her 
 She's got boyfriend, but unfaithful
 She's got a lack of faith
 Also hope and true love
 Its enough for stricking a match
 But she's got time to find missing links

  Life is not to take
  More often you need to give yourself
  We must believe in where we're going
  We must have hope to continue our purpose
  We must find love to support us in bad times
  Believe, cherish hope and love will come
  Change your life, calculate it
  Go back on your way to fulfilment

 All our lives we fight for money
 We destruct each other
 We envy and start lethal wars
 Kill others to get material goods
 Do we really need it all?
 Don't matter what's outside
 More important what's inside us
 We have to believe in something better
 We have to cherish hope that it will become
 We must have love which'll let us grow up
 We must understand and fulfil that
 Then will approach the best time for all of us

  Life is not to take
  More often you need to give yourself
  We must believe in where we're going
  We must have hope to continue our purpose
  We must find love to support us in bad times
  Believe, cherish hope and love will come
  Change your life, calculate it
  Go back on your way to fulfilment
